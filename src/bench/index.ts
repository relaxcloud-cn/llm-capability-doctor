/**
 * The mini benchmark.
 *
 * Informational only — it never feeds a score or the exit code. What makes it a
 * benchmark rather than the incidental per-request timing we already had:
 *
 *  - a warmup run per scenario, discarded, so cold model-load / cache-warm
 *    never leaks into the number;
 *  - K measured runs, reported as median (min–max), never a single figure;
 *  - a unique lead-in on every request, so the engine's prompt/prefix cache
 *    (llama.cpp slots, vLLM APC, LM Studio, Ollama) can never serve a measured
 *    run from an earlier run's KV — a cache hit collapses TTFT and makes
 *    prefill read as tens of thousands of tok/s;
 *  - a black-box speculative-decoding / MTP probe: decode throughput on
 *    predictable content (verbatim echo) versus novel content. Speculation only
 *    pays when the draft is accepted, which happens far more on predictable
 *    output, so the ratio is the signature of a working MTP/draft path.
 *
 * That probe also runs at every rung of the context ladder, because engines
 * routinely starve or disable a draft path as the KV cache grows — "MTP works"
 * measured on a 500-token prompt says nothing about 32k.
 *
 * Cross-engine comparison is only valid on the same hardware; the report says so.
